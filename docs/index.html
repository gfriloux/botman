  <h1 class="page-heading">Botman</h1>
    Botman is a project that aims to ease management of multiple servers.<br />
    Focus is put around a few concepts :
    <ul>
      <li>Modularity : Everything is a module. This force clean isolation of functions,
                       making the addition of functionnalities a lot easier.
      </li>
      <li>Spam : We focus on making it easy to send commands to servers using patterns,
                 allowing to query every server at once or only a subset of them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />

  <h1>How it works</h1>
  This project create 2 apps :
  <ul>
    <li>Botman : Simple bot installed on servers to manage.</li>
    <li>Alfred : Bot assistant installed on an external machine.</li>
  </ul>
  Botman & Alfred will talk through an XMPP server.<br />
  We chose XMPP over other networks because its open, standardized,
  extendable, and have multiple servers and clients available (as well as libraries).<br />
  The way Botman & Alfred talk depends heavily on how modules are written (as each of them
  is somewhat independant), but everything tends to work around commands.<br />
  The best practice seems to only talk to Alfred, and have it dispatch your commands
  to botmans.<br />
  Talking with Alfred can be done through the XMPP network, or through the
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/modules/httpd.html">HTTPd module</a>.
  <br /><br />

  <h1>Security</h1>
    <h2>XMPP Server</h2>
      You should limit access to your XMPP server :
      <ul>
        <li>Turn off account registration : Only admins can create new accounts.</li>
        <li>Restrict IP access to your XMPP server if your servers and users only connects from known locations.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Alfred/Botman friendlist</h2>
      You can set <code>JID patterns</code> in both alfred.conf and botman.conf, to filter
      contacts allowed to add them as friends and talk to them.
    <h2>Access module</h2>
      It is possible to give access levels to both commands and users, to restrict
      certains user to only a subset of available ones.
    <h2>HTTPd module</h2>
      This module does not support any kind of authentification mechanism, and offer a direct
      gateway to Alfred's internals.<br />
      So you might either filter access to port 5128 or completely deny it, and proxify it through
      nginx/apache, adding http auth in the middle.
