  <h1 class="page-heading">Botman</h1>
    Botman is a project that aims to ease management of multiple servers.<br />
    Focus is put around a few concepts :
    <ul>
      <li>Modularity : Everything is a module. This force clean isolation of functions,
                       making the addition of functionnalities a lot easier.
      </li>
      <li>Spam : We focus on making it easy to send commands to servers using patterns,
                 allowing to query every server or once or only a subset of them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />

  <h1>How it works</h1>
  This project create 2 apps :
  <ul>
    <li>Botman : Simple bot installed on servers to manage.</li>
    <li>Alfred : Bot assistant installed on an external machine.</li>
  </ul>
  Botman & Alfred will talk through an XMPP server.<br />
  We chose XMPP over other networks because its open, standardized,
  extendable, and have multiple servers and clients available (as well as libraries).<br />
  The way Botman & Alfred talk depends heavily on how modules are written (as each of them
  if somewhat independant), but everything tends to work around commands.<br />
  The best practice seems to only talk to Alfred, and have it dispatch your commands
  to botmans.<br />
  Talking with Alfred can be done through the XMPP network, or through the
  <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/modules/httpd.html">HTTPd module</a>.

  <h1>Modules</h1>
  <ul>
  {% for module in site.modules %}
    <li><a href="{{ module.url | prepend: site.github.url }}" class="post-link">{{module.title}}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>
